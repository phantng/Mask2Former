## Features
* A single architecture for three tasks: panoptic, instance and semantic segmentation. This straightforward mini project was built as part of the main project, IST: A TensorFlow 2 compatible instance segmentation toolbox, with the purpose of adapting recent research into segmentation approaches into TensorFlow.
* Support common benchmark datasets: ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO, Mapillary Vistas.

## Getting started
Project is currently being built, with SwinTransformerV1 and SwinTransformerV2 and a few bits and pieces ready.
